LeetCode Problem 200: Number of Islands

Problem Description:
Given an m x n 2D binary grid grid which represents a map of '1's (land) and '0's (water), 
return the number of islands.

An island is surrounded by water and is formed by connecting adjacent lands horizontally or vertically. 
You may assume all four edges of the grid are all surrounded by water.

Time Complexity: O(m * n) where m and n are the dimensions of the grid
Space Complexity: O(m * n) in worst case for the recursion stack

Example:
Input: grid = [
  ["1","1","1","1","0"],
  ["1","1","0","1","0"],
  ["1","1","0","0","0"],
  ["0","0","0","0","0"]
]
Output: 1

Input: grid = [
  ["1","1","0","0","0"],
  ["1","1","0","0","0"],
  ["0","0","1","0","0"],
  ["0","0","0","1","1"]
]
Output: 3

Approach: DFS to mark visited islands and count connected components.
